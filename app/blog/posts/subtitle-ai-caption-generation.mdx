## Getting Started with Subtitle

### Installation

FFmpeg First, you need to install FFmpeg. Here's how you can do it:
```bash
# On Linux
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

Clone the Repository: Clone the Subtitle repository from GitHub using
the command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/innovatorved/subtitle.git.
cd subtitle
```

Install Dependencies: Install the project's dependencies using the
command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run

You can run the script from the command line using the following
command:
```bash
python subtitle.py <filepath | video_url> [--model <modelname>]
```

Replace `<filepath | video_url>` with the path to your video file. The
`--model` argument is optional. If not provided, it will use 'base' as
the default model.

For example:
```bash
python subtitle.py /path/to/your/video.mp4 --model base
```

This will run the script on the video at `/path/to/your/video.mp4` using
the base model. Please replace `/path/to/your/video.mp4` with the actual
path to your video file.
