        About Me
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hi there! I'm a Cloud Engineer with a strong foundation in web development and a passion for crafting optimized digital solutions. I started my journey in tech through freelancing, working on diverse projects and honing my skills in React, Next.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
<br/><br/>
I transitioned to a full-time Cloud Developer role at LTIMindtree, where I focus on building robust cloud solutions and exploring advanced ML/DL models. This mix of cloud engineering and hands-on development experience allows me to create efficient, scalable applications.
