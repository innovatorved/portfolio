This application converts text, PDFs, or conversations into speech using Kokoro-TTS or Chatterbox TTS engines. It is designed for scalability and reliability, capable of processing very large files like entire books, with progress tracking and job resumption capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Scalable & Reliable:** Built with a job-based architecture to handle large files. It can process an entire book without memory issues.
- **Parallel Processing:** Utilizes multiple CPU processes to convert text to speech, significantly speeding up large jobs.
- **Job-Based System:** Every conversion is a "job" tracked in a local SQLite database. This means the state is saved, and you can manage multiple conversions.
- **Progress Tracking:** Monitor the real-time progress of any running job using the command line.
- **Fault-Tolerant:** Resume failed or interrupted jobs exactly from where they left off. No more lost work!
- **Web UI with Job Dashboard:** A modern web interface for easily creating jobs and a dashboard to view the status of all past and present jobs.
- **Multiple Input Formats:** Convert direct text, PDF documents, or plain text files.
- **Choice of Engines:** Use Kokoro (multilingual) for versatility or Chatterbox (English) for high-quality, expressive speech.
- **Customizable Output:** Control language, voice, and speed. Final audio can be automatically merged into a single file.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/innovatorved/tts-app.git
    cd tts-app
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install build tools and dependencies:**
    First, ensure your `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` are up to date, which can prevent common installation issues:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    ```
    Then, install the application's dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Web UI

The application includes a modern web interface built with Gradio.

### Running the Web UI

```bash
python webui.py
```

The web UI will be available at `http://localhost:7860` and includes:
- **Create Job Tab:** A simplified interface to create new TTS jobs from text or uploaded files.
- **Job Dashboard Tab:** View the status of all jobs (`completed`, `processing`, `failed`), see when they were created, and refresh the list.

## Command-Line Usage

The job-based system is powerful and easy to use. Here’s how to work with it.

### Creating a Job

To start a new conversion, you create a job. For example, to convert a PDF book:

```bash
python main.py --pdf "path/to/your/book.pdf" --job-name "my-book-job" --num-workers 4 --merge_output
```

- `--pdf "path/to/your/book.pdf"`: Specifies the input file.
- `--job-name "my-book-job"`: Gives the job a unique name for tracking.
- `--num-workers 4`: The number of parallel processes to use.
- `--merge_output`: Automatically stitch the final audio chunks into a single WAV file.

### Monitoring a Job

While a job is running, you can monitor its progress in a separate terminal:

```bash
python main.py --monitor --job-name "my-book-job"
```

### Resuming a Failed Job

If a job is interrupted, you can easily resume it:

```bash
python main.py --resume --job-name "my-book-job" --num-workers 4
```

### Engine-Specific Options

You can choose between the `kokoro` and `chatterbox` engines and customize their settings.

#### Kokoro Engine Options

- `--lang "code"`: Language code (e.g., 'en' for English).
- `--voice "name"`: Voice model name.
- `--speed <float>`: Speech speed multiplier.

**Example:**

```bash
python main.py --text "Hello world" --engine kokoro --lang "en" --voice "en_us_001" --speed 1.2
```

#### Chatterbox Engine Options

- `--cb_audio_prompt <path.wav>`: Path to a reference audio file to guide the voice.
- `--cb_exaggeration <float>`: Emotion/intensity control.
- `--cb_cfg_weight <float>`: Guidance weight.
- `--cb_temperature <float>`: Sampling temperature.
- `--cb_top_p <float>`: Nucleus sampling `p` value.
- `--cb_min_p <float>`: Minimum `p` value for nucleus sampling.
- `--cb_repetition_penalty <float>`: Penalty for repeating tokens.

**Example:**

```bash
python main.py --text "This is an expressive test." --engine chatterbox --cb_audio_prompt "path/to/prompt.wav" --cb_exaggeration 0.7
```
