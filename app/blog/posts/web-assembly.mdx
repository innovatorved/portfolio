WebAssembly (also known as Wasm) is a new technology that is being
developed to enable high-performance applications on the web. It is
designed to be a low-level language that can be used to write efficient
and safe code that can be run in web browsers.

WebAssembly is not intended to replace JavaScript, but rather to
complement it and provide an alternative for certain types of
applications.

- WebAssembly is a low-level, assembly-like language that runs in web
  browsers and other environments.
- WebAssembly is a low-level language, which means it can be used to
  compile code written in a variety of higher-level languages,
  including C, C++, Rust, and TypeScript.
- WebAssembly can be used to create web applications that have
  previously been impossible or impractical to run in a web browser,
  such as applications with high-performance graphics or complex
  computations.
- WebAssembly has a growing ecosystem of tools, libraries, and
  frameworks that can be used to develop and deploy web applications.
  These include tools for debugging and performance analysis, as well
  as libraries for graphics, audio, and other common application
  needs.

Here is an example of how WebAssembly can be used to compile and run code
written in a high-level language in a web browser

Suppose we have the following simple C++ function, which calculates the
factorial of a given number:

**factorial.cpp**
```cpp
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

We can compile this function to WebAssembly using a tool such as
Emscripten. This will generate a binary file (with a .wasm extension)
that contains the compiled code.

To compile this code to WebAssembly, you would use a tool such as
Emscripten. For example, you could use the following command:
```bash
emcc factorial.cpp -o factorial.wasm
```

To run this code in a web page, we can use the WebAssembly JavaScript
API to load and instantiate the .wasm file. This will create an
instance of the WebAssembly module, which we can then call like any
other JavaScript function:
```javascript
const wasmModule = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch('factorial.wasm'
));
const factorial = wasmModule.instance.exports.factorial;

console.log(factorial(5)); // 120
```

In this example, the factorial() function is compiled to WebAssembly
and run in the browser, allowing us to perform high-performance
calculations in the browser without the need for a plugin or other
runtime.

### Pros
- Fast and efficient execution of compiled code in the browser or other
environments
- Supports a wide range of programming languages
- Supported by all major web browsers
- In short, WebAssembly allows developers to create high-performance web
applications that can be deployed and run on a wide range of devices
and platforms.

### Cons
- Low-level language can be difficult to write and debug
- Primarily designed for use in web browsers, limiting flexibility and
portability
- Relatively new and not as well-supported as other web development
technologies
