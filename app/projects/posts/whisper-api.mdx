This open source project provides a self-hostable API for speech to text transcription using a finetuned Whisper ASR model. The API allows you to easily convert audio files to text through HTTP requests. Ideal for adding speech recognition capabilities to your applications.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Speech Recognition:** Uses a finetuned Whisper model for high-quality speech-to-text conversion.
- **Simple HTTP API:** Easily transcribe audio files through simple HTTP requests.
- **User-Level Access:** Manage usage with API keys for different users.
- **Self-Hostable:** Deploy your own speech transcription service for privacy and control.
- **Optimized for Speed:** Utilizes a quantized model for fast and efficient inference.
- **Open Source:** Fully transparent and customizable to fit your needs.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
# Install ffmpeg for Audio Processing
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Install Python Package
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://innovatorved-whisper-api.hf.space/api/v1/users/get_token' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "email": "example@domain.com",
  "password": "password"
}'
```

## Example to Transcribe a File

To upload a file and transcribe it, use the following command: Note: The token is a dummy token and will not work. Please use the token provided by the admin.

Here are the available models:
- `tiny.en`
- `tiny.en.q5`
- `base.en.q5`

```bash
# Modify the token and audioFilePath
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/transcribe/?model=tiny.en.q5' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authentication: e9b7658aa93342c492fa64153849c68b8md9uBmaqCwKq4VcgkuBD0G54FmsE8JT' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'file=@audioFilePath.wav;type=audio/wav'
```
