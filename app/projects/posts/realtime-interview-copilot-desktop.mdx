Ever been in an interview where a curveball question makes your brain take an unscheduled vacation? Yeah, me too. That's why I built a desktop app that acts as your AI copilot—listening, transcribing, and crafting intelligent responses in real-time.

Meet **Realtime Interview Copilot: Desktop Edition**—the evolution of the [web version](/projects/realtime-interview-copilot), now as a native desktop app with some serious superpowers.

## What Makes It Special?

### 🔒 Screen Share Protection

The killer feature: **the app window is completely hidden during screen sharing**. Share your screen on Zoom, Meet, or Teams, and it stays invisible. No awkward explanations, no scrambling—it just disappears from their view while staying functional on yours.

### 🎤 Real-Time Audio Capture

Captures system audio using loopback software (BlackHole for macOS, VB-Audio for Windows). The interviewer asks a question, Deepgram transcribes it instantly, and Google Generative AI crafts a context-aware response. All in seconds.

### 🧠 Dual Modes

**Copilot Mode**: Detailed, structured responses for technical or behavioral questions.

**Summarizer Mode**: Quick summaries to keep track of the conversation.

Switch with `Ctrl/Cmd + C` or `S` shortcuts.

### 💬 Floating AI Assistant

Press `K` to summon an "Ask AI" box. Type any question mid-interview and get instant answers without breaking your flow.

## Why I Built This

Interviews are stressful, and not everyone performs their best under pressure. This tool helps reduce anxiety and communicate what you already know more effectively. Think of it as training wheels—it helps you until you can ride on your own.

**Use responsibly**: Always check your interview platform's terms of service. This is for assistance and learning, not deception.

## Open Source & Community

73 stars on GitHub and growing. The code is fully open source—fork it, customize it, learn from it. That's the beauty of sharing.

**Roadmap**: Better Windows/Linux support, custom AI models, interview replay features, and more. But mostly, I want your feedback.
